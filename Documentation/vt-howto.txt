Build-Howto for Afterburner VT:

1) You'll need a VT-Box, preferably with a serial device connected to
a terminal on a different PC. You can alternatively have L4 and Linux
putting their debug output on a screen, but the default configuration
uses the first serial port.

2) Get the mercurial module pistachio-vt from
http://i30www.ira.uka.de/~stoess/public/hg/pistachio-vt.  
User/pass realvms/realvms.

3) Find the user-level parts of the virtualization stack under
http://i30www.ira.uka.de/~stoess/public/hg/afterburner. 
User/pass again realvms/realvms. 

afterburner-vt module will contain build infrastructure that downloads
Linux and patches it appropriately. Be aware that we don't support too
many virtual devices yet; for passthrough access, for which you'll
need to translate guest physical into host physical addresses, you may
want to use an afterburned Linux instead.

4) Find a README.txt for the original afterburner in
afterburner/README.txt.

5) copy the file afterburner/Documentation/vt-config.out to your
afterburner build directory. Edit it, either via "make menuconfig/make
xconfig" or by hand. In the submenu "L4KA environment", specify the
path to the downloaded pistachio-vt module in "Custom Pistachio Source
Directory"

5) Build all modules via "make world"

6) The boot directory will now contain all necessary files.

7) You'll need a ram disk for Linux to boot up. If you don't have a ram disk
file at hand, find a gzipped one at
http://i30www.ira.uka.de/~stoess/public/ramdisk128.gz

8) Boot your VT Box using grub. To give grub access to the boot files,
either use TFTP, or copy them to a local disk. You can find a sample
grub menu.lst in afterburner-vt/Documentation/menu.lst.vt

9) Connect to the serial port of the box, e.g., using minicom or Kermit.
Default setting is currently 57600 baud. You'll see a lot of debug output
from l4, the user-level virtualization modules (resourcemon, afterburn) and,
hopefully, Linux.

Kind regards,
