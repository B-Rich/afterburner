I tried lmdd from lmbench to measure disk bandwidth.  The hypervisor 
has slightly better performance than the native Linux.  But I don't
know enough about the benchmark to know whether this is true.

I used a file size too large to fit in the cache, to force disk activity.
The question is whether both the hypervisor and native Linux trigger
the same amount of disk activity.

Disk write:
  lmdd if=internal of=/mnt/xxx count=100000

Disk read:
  lmdd if=/mnt/xxx of=internal
