Fast-path system call patch for glibc.

Tested with the Debian glibc-2.3.2.ds1 source package.

Instructions: Copy the l4.dpatch file to the debian/patches directory.
Then add "l4" to the end of the debian/patches/00list file, so that the
l4 patch is applied last.  Then a dpkg-buildpackage command should 
build most of glibc.  It will stop as soon as the build process tries to
invoke the binaries which it is building, since they aren't runnable on
native Linux.

NOTE: this is a partial patch.  It doesn't update some functions, such as
clone(), to use the fast path.
