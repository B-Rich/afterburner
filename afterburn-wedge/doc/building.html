<h1>Building the Afterburner</h1>

<h2>Patched Assembler -- binutils</h2>

Check-out the <code>binutils</code> module from source control.  It contains
some patches to correct bugs in the assembler's parser, and an extra operator
to disable macro expansion.  You need this assembler to use the Afterburner.

<p>
If you use gcc 2.95, it is sufficient to give priority in the search path for
the modified assembler over the standard assembler.  In newer versions of
gcc, the compiler chooses the assembler based on the location of the
compiler, and thus it becomes necessary to replace the original assembler,
or to build your own binutils and compiler, located at some place under
your control.

<p>
To build the binutils:
<ol>
<li> The source directory is <code>${SRCDIR}</code>.
<li> The build directory is <code>${BUILDDIR}</code>.
<li> The installation tree root is <code>${INSTALLDIR}</code>.
<li> Create the empty build directory.
<li> Change into the build directory.
<li> Execute the configure script: 
<code>${SRCDIR}/configure --prefix=${INSTALLDIR}</code>.
If building for a cross-compilation environment, additionally specify the
target parameter, for example <code>--target=i386-elf</code>.
<li> You can build only the compiler (which is named gas),
<code>make all-gas</code>, or the entire binutils collection.
<li> When the build succeeds, it generates a binary named 
<code>${BUILDDIR}/gas/new-as</code>.  To use this binary, create a symbolic 
link to this file using the name <code>as</code> and add to your 
search path so that it is chosen before the normal <code>as</code>.  
Alternatively, execute <code>make install-gas</code> to install the 
<code>as</code> binary in your chosen installation location, and ensure
that it is in your search path.  Note that newer gcc versions, such
as gcc 3.3.4, will not search your path for <code>as</code>, but will 
instead choose the <code>as</code> that is installed in close proximity 
to gcc.  Thus you may need to build and install the entire binutils and gcc.
</ol>


<h2>Building Linux 2.6</h2>

We don't rely on the standard, final build output.  We use the intermediate 
<code>vmlinux</code> ELF binary, but after stripping it and compressing it.

<p>
The following script automates the build process (it forces a rebuild if
the Afterburn wedge has changed).  The <code>LOC</code> variable is
the Linux 2.6 build directory.  The <code>WEDGE</code> variable is the
location of the Afterburner's build output.  And <code>SCP_TARGET</code>
is the destination for installing the final Linux kernel binary.

<p>
The script accepts all command line arguments intended for the Linux 2.6
build system, such as <code>menuconfig</code>.  Additionaly, you can
avoid building the final compressed Linux image by just telling it to
build <code>vmlinux</code> on the command line.

<xmp>#!/bin/sh

set -e

LOC=/export/joshua/afterburn/linux-2.6-afterburn/p4solo
WEDGE=/export/joshua/afterburn/afterburn-wedge/build-l4ka
SCP_TARGET=i30pc32:tftpboot/afterburn/linux-p4solo

## The current Linux build modifications don't detect changes in the
## afterburn object code file.  So force a relink if necessary.
if [ ${WEDGE}/afterburn-wedge.o -nt ${LOC}/vmlinux ] ; then
  rm -f ${LOC}/vmlinux
  rm -f ${LOC}/System.map
  rm -f ${LOC}/.tmp_kallsyms?.S
  rm -f ${LOC}/.tmp_kallsyms?.o
fi

make O=${LOC} $*
if [ ${LOC}/vmlinux -nt ${LOC}/vmlinux.stripped ] ; then
  echo Making vmlinuz
  strip -o ${LOC}/vmlinux.stripped ${LOC}/vmlinux
  gzip -fc ${LOC}/vmlinux.stripped > ${LOC}/vmlinuz
  echo Copying to ${SCP_TARGET}
  scp ${LOC}/vmlinuz ${SCP_TARGET}
  scp ${LOC}/.config ${SCP_TARGET}-config
fi
</xmp>

<h2>Building Linux 2.6 on Mac OS X</h2>

In <code>linux/scripts/Makefile.host</code>, change <code>-shared</code>
to <code>-dynamiclib -flat_namespace -single_module</code>.
<p>
When building, specify the target architecture and the cross compilation
prefix, on the make command line.  For example,
<code>make O=${LINUX_BUILDDIR} ARCH=i386 CROSS_COMPILE=i386-elf-</code>.
